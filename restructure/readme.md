# Trading Strategy with Two-Step Hedging and Threshold-Based Closure

This script demonstrates a threshold-based trading strategy with an additional hedging mechanism. The strategy involves placing trades when certain price thresholds are reached, hedging with opposite trades upon price reversals, and closing trades to lock in profits when further thresholds are met.

Overview

The strategy initiates trades based on a threshold system, tracks price reversals to place hedging trades, and finally monitors the price to close trades if a subsequent opposite threshold is reached. This approach aims to minimize losses and capture potential profits during price reversals.
### How It Works

#### 1. Initial Trade Placement

The code begins by monitoring the price movements. When a price reaches a 1 threshold (either positive or negative) from the start_price, an initial trade is placed:

    Positive Threshold (+1): A buy trade is placed.
    Negative Threshold (-1): A sell trade is placed.

#### 2. Hedging with Opposite Trades

After the initial trade is placed, the script continues to monitor price movements:

    If the price reverses to reach or cross the 0.5 threshold in the opposite direction, two opposite trades are placed to hedge the initial position.
        For instance, if a buy trade was placed at the +1 threshold, and the price reverses to 0.5, two sell trades are initiated.
    These hedging trades help minimize potential losses from the initial trade and enable profit capture if the reversal persists.

#### 3. Monitoring and Closing Trades

After the hedging trades are placed, the script monitors for further movement to an opposite 1 threshold:

    If the price reaches a 1 threshold in the opposite direction from the hedging entry, it indicates a strong reversal.
    In this case, the opposite trades are closed at a gain, capturing profits from the price movement in the opposite direction.

Code Structure
Key Functions

    calculate_pip_difference: Calculates the pip difference between the current price and the start price.
    check_thresholds: Calculates how many thresholds (relative to the configured pip_size and positive_pip_difference) have been crossed.
    trigger_trade_by_threshold: Main function that:
        Places the initial trade at the 1 threshold.
        Initiates two hedging trades if the price reverses to 0.5 threshold after the initial trade.
        Closes hedging trades at the opposite 1 threshold after the hedging entry.
    place_hedging_trades: Simulates placing two trades in the opposite direction when a reversal is detected.
    close_trade: Simulates closing a trade when the opposite 1 threshold is reached after hedging.

Variables

    trade_placed: Tracks whether the initial trade has been placed.
    initial_direction: Tracks the direction of the initial trade ("buy" or "sell").
    hedging_entry_price: Records the price at which hedging trades are initiated.

Example Price Sequence

The combined_prices list includes a sequence of prices that simulate both buy and sell cases to demonstrate the strategy:

    Buy Case: Prices initially rise, crossing the +1 threshold to place a buy trade, then reverse to trigger hedging with two sell trades.
    Sell Case: Prices initially fall, crossing the -1 threshold to place a sell trade, then reverse to trigger hedging with two buy trades.
